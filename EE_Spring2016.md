# Potential speakers for the Ecology and Evolution group.

By luck our fall slots gotten filled up by several great speakers (Dolph Schluter, Judith Bronstein and Simon Levin) from other sources (and luck). However we need to pick our winter-spring speakers.

Below I list speakers that have been nominated. We need to pick three more. As our speakers in the fall are mostly being paid from other sources, we can potentially have two of them be from "away" (so we can afford to fly them in). We can also potentially invite a few of these for the wednesday colloquium.Indeed since many of the candidates are local, and 2/3 of the fall speakers are already paid for (and we only pay half for the third speaker) I think we could probably use some of the regular seminar funds to bring in a bunch of these for the wednesday colloquium, if you are all in agreement.
